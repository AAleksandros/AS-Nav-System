# Autonomous Navigation Agent

> Computer vision system for autonomous obstacle avoidance using YOLOv11 and rule-based navigation

A Python-based autonomous navigation system that processes drone footage to simulate intelligent obstacle avoidance. The system uses YOLO object detection combined with a state machine for navigation decisions, producing annotated video outputs showing the agent's decision-making process.

#TO-DO: Add project details and instructions for testing.
